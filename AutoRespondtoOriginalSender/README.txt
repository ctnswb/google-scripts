The autoReply function is for those who use forwarding emails and would like to send an auto reply to the original sender rather than send an auto reply to the forwarding address. 

The function checks the gmail inbox for any threads that have not been responded to. For each of those messages, it sends a reply back cc'ing the original "from" address.
